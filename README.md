## About
    A simple music player for Internet radio streams
    Works perfect from a localhost connection but there is an issue.
        firefox, chrome and othere browsers do not like to mix https and http
        the url's are http that stream the music so once in production nothing 
        will play. Unless the user specifically tells their browser to allow unsecure

    This would lead to a poor user experience. feel free to clone and use this for personal use, but deploying it will get you no where fast.

    I may just turn this into an electron app so it could have a purpose.

## Now this is a desktop app!
    currently a fully function desktop app as is.
    will add in more features to make it more awesome!


## Do it yourself
    1. clone repo
    2. open terminal in instal location
    3. npm install
    4. npm run build
    5. in file explore navigate to /dist, find app image
    6. launch app!
