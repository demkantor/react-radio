    A simple music player for Internet radio streams
    Works perfect from a localhost connection but there is an issue.
        firefox, chrome and othere browsers do not like to mix https and http
        the url's are http that stream the music so once in production nothing 
        will play. Unless the user specifically tells their browser to allow unsecure

    This would lead to a poor user experience. feel free to clone and use this for personal use, but deploying it will get you no where fast.

    I may just turn this into an electron app so it could have a purpose.
